About Auto-playï¼š

Click the "open" button,<br/>
Open a formula text file, and press A to auto-play.<br/>
Manual operations are not allowed when auto-playing; press E to quit auto-play.<br/>


The formats can be found in \res\sample_formula.txt.<br/>
The apostrophe needs to be half-width, split steps by spaces.<br/>
Auto-play will stop when encountering the first unrecognizable character.<br/>


All steps that are recognizable:<br/>
R R' R2 U U' U2 F F' F2<br/>
L L' L2 D D' D2 B B' B2<br/>
x x' x2 y y' y2 z z' z2<br/>


M(Middle) and lowercase letters(double layer) are not supported for now, please convert manually.<br/>
Counterclockwise 180 degrees is not supported for now, please convert to clockwise 180 degrees manually.<br/>
