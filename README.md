About Auto-playï¼š

Click the "open" button,
Open a formula text file, and press A to auto-play.
Manual operations are not allowed when auto-playing; press E to quit auto-play.

The formats can be found in \res\sample_formula.txt.
The apostrophe needs to be half-width, split steps by spaces.
Auto-play will stop when encountering the first unrecognizable character.

All steps that are recognizable:
R R' R2 U U' U2 F F' F2
L L' L2 D D' D2 B B' B2
x x' x2 y y' y2 z z' z2

M(Middle) and lowercase letters(double layer) are not supported for now, please convert manually.
Counterclockwise 180 degrees is not supported for now, please convert to clockwise 180 degrees manually.
